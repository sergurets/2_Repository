         <h1>What is Keystroke Dynamics</h1>
         <p>Keystroke dynamics is the process of analyzing the way a user types by monitoring the keyboard inputs thousands of times per second in an attempt to identify users based on habitual typing rhythm patterns It has already been shown see that keystroke rhythm is a good sign of identity. Moreover unlike other biometric systems which may be expensive to implement keystroke dynamics requires only a keyboard.

         <h1>FAQ</h1>
         <h2>Why it’s better?</h2>
         <p>In contrast to other biometric authentication systems, keystroke dynamics offers the promise of high confidence user identification without the need of special hardware.</p>
         <h2>Why not just use more stringent requirements for password strength?</h2>
         <p>A password that is easy to remember is generally also easy for an attacker to guess. Passwords that are difficult to remember will reduce the security of a system because (a) users might need to write down or electronically store the password using an insecure method, (b) users will need frequent password resets and (c) users are more likely to re-use the same password.</p>
         <h2>What data are you storing?</h2>
         <p>We are storing the User's identifier that is provided to us by the party that integrates Keystroke DNA into their web application. The User Identifier can be anything including a combination of random character or an e-mail address. In addition, we create and store biometric profiles, which are based on the User's typing patterns on various devices.</p>
         <h2>What languages does Keystroke DNA support?</h2>
         <p>Keystroke dynamics is efficient in any language as it analyses only the typing patterns and not what is actually being typed. Therefore, our algorithms are technically language independent.

         <p>In contrast to other biometric authentication systems, keystroke dynamics offers the promise of high confidence user identification without the need of any special hardware.

         <h2>What is the origin of Keystroke Dynamics?</h2>
         <p>During World War II, Military Intelligence discovered that an individual had a unique rhythm of keying in a Morse Code message. As a result, this biometric feature was used to distinguish ally from enemy and later became known as keystroke dynamics.	</p>
